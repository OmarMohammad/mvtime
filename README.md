Site we built for a school project. 
We used react-redux and firebase-auth and in the backend .NET Core. This project was originally hosted on Git Visual Studio Teamservices
where we had configured a build and deployment pipeline. Using continuous integration and continuous deployment as well as many 
other DevOps best practices. Local development was done using a docker sql-server image. It was a really fun project where I got to 
play around with firebase authentication, react-redux and a lot of the DevOps practices.
